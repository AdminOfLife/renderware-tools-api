# renderware-tools-api

RenderWare Tools API is a web service providing endpoints to work with RenderWare file formats such as DFF (geometry) and TXD (texture archive).

The tools are based on [rwtools](https://github.com/aap/rwtools) and [this](https://hub.docker.com/r/southclaws/rwtools/) Docker image combined with a basic Go web server to provide a RESTful API for working with .dff and .txd files.
